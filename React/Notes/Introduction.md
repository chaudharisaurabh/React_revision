## React Overview

**React** is a popular open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. Developed and maintained by Facebook, it allows developers to create large web applications that can update and render efficiently in response to data changes.

## Key Features

- **Component-Based**: UI is built using reusable components.
- **Declarative**: Makes it easy to design interactive UIs by describing what the UI should look like.
- **Virtual DOM**: Enhances performance by minimizing direct interactions with the real DOM.
- **Unidirectional Data Flow**: Data flows in one direction, making the app predictable and easier to debug.
- **JSX**: JavaScript syntax extension that allows writing HTML-like code in JavaScript.

React is widely used in modern web development due to its flexibility, performance, and robust ecosystem.
